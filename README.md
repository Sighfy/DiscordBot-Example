# DiscordBot-Example
A small example discord bot using discord.py 2.3.2

To set up simply get a discord app token from https://discord.com/developers after creating an app, and add that to token.json under the config folder.

Create a new folder named config
-> make a file "config.json" and enter this:

{
    "token": "INPUT TOKEN KEY HERE"
}
